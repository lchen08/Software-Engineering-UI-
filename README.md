# CS4800 Software Engineering Project - Mobile App for Blockchain Class Project
Authors: Hao Ming You, Lisa Chen, Johnson Wei, Laura Campos, Jin Kim

## Description

Completed in Spring 2019, the project was to teach the class about software engineering concepts and work on a large project using Blockchain. The goal was to create an application where a user can search a product by its ID/UPN, name, and/or supplier and find all the materials that make up the product. In additin, the user can also click on the components of the products to find more information about the component and its sub-components as well. 

The class is split to multiple teams of 3-5 where each team is responsible for different aspects of the project: API, Blockchain, Component Database, ERP, Mobile UI, and Desktop UI. 

Our team was responsible for Mobile UI where are code submission can be found here. The project is currently not running; the Blockchains that connect to the API that interfaces with our project are all taken down due to running costs and this being a short-term project. A test case was added to demonstrate how the application works.

Furthermore, the team responsible for creating the Component Database never completed the work; thus, the code for handling components are commented out as it was not clear how the other team would implement the component search. 

A presentation summarizing the submission and our accomplishments can be found here:
