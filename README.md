# CS4800 Software Engineering Project - Mobile App for Blockchain Class Project
Team: Hao Ming You, Lisa Chen, Johnson Wei, Laura Campos, Jin Kim

## Description

Completed in Spring 2019, the project was to teach the class about software engineering concepts and work on a large project using Blockchain. The goal was to create an application where a user can search a product by its ID/UPN, name, and/or supplier and find all the materials that make up the product. In addition, the user can also click on the components of the products to find more information about the component and its sub-components as well. 

The class is split to multiple teams of 3-5 where each team is responsible for different aspects of the project: API, Blockchain, Component Database, ERP, Mobile UI, and Desktop UI. Finally, all teams were to implement the project using Agile Methodology and create the following documentation:

**Functional/Requirement Spec (BA)**
- Use Cases
- Activity Diagrams
- Domain Object Model or ER Diagram

**Technical/Design Spec (DEV)**
- Context (Deployment) Diagram
- Architecture Layout
- Component Diagram
- Class Hierarchy & Relationship Diagrams
- Sequence Diagrams

**Test Case Spec (QA)**
- Test Strategy/Approach
- Test Plan
  - Traceability Matrix
  - Test Cases
- Test Results Summary

## Project Summary
Our team was responsible for Mobile UI where are code submission can be found here. We used Android Studio to implement the project and designed the program with the intention to be compatible with phones of various sizes up to Android Lollipop OS. The project is currently not running; the Blockchains that connect to the API that interfaces with our project are all taken down due to running costs and this being a short-term project. A test case was added to demonstrate how the application works.

Furthermore, the team responsible for creating the Component Database never completed the work; thus, the code for handling components are commented out as it was not clear how the other team would implement the component search. 

A presentation summarizing the submission and our accomplishments can be found here:
